# Data cleaning and classification (Mini project)

This was one of my first brushes with data cleaning. As a part of my mini project at college I summarized everything I had learnt on a Kaggle course using a dataset with Iowa Housing Prices.
It also has some cursory implimentations of classification, albiet using predefined packages. If anything, it was great practice for understanding the flow of a project (Explore, clean, combine, utilize models) in a broad manner. It was also great practice for markdown and organization in Jupyter.
